        <img src="me.jpg" alt="picure of me">
        <p>Hello! I'm Jacob, an Information Technology Major at UW-GB! I stared here in the fall, and have learned to love this school. Some things I enjoy are hiking, skiing, camping and also playing games, either board games or video games. With the first eyar wrapping up, I am excited for next year, as I am taking more classes for my major. I am also looking to get a job at the OAC on campus. I think working there would be really fun and potentially setting up some adventure trips. </p>

            <h3>AES Research Presentation</h3>
            <p>For my Professional Writing for Business Majors class, we were tasked with researching something about Artificial Intelligence and compile out groups research into a 30-page analytical paper. There was an option for free points if the group agreed to submit a slide presentation to the Academic Excellence Symposium. My group participated in the Symposium and presented our research last Wednesday. </p>

            <h3>German "Pen Pal"</h3>
            <p>My German professor collaborated with a professor in Germany that he knew, paring us up with a parter whom we would call once about every week. My parter, Oliver Jaeger was a pretty cool guy. I learned a lot about German cultre from him, and would like to keep in-touch after this semester. We kept a journal of what we talked about, new words I learned and anything intersting.</p>
